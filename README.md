# Advanced-RTOS
ARM is the industry's leading supplier of microprocessor technology, offering the widest range of microprocessor cores to address the performance, power and cost requirements for almost all application markets. The aim is to develop advanced LPC1768 ARM processor without compromising the performance. RTOS with library functions which can be accessed remotely adds advantage to this processor in terms of efficiency, performance, memory, speed. In conventional processor there is no enough memory to perform complicated algorithms and tasks in image processing such as face recognition, fingerprint authentication, etc. In order to overcome this problem web service is incorporated with this processor. A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet. Web service includes a web server which handles standard library functions and complicated functions like image processing functions. This will provide easy access to the user who needs to perform complicated functions. With the help of this web service time and memory consuming processes can be done in am efficient manner.
